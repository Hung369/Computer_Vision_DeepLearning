# Deep Learning Practice

This repo is about all deep learning exercises using PyTorch and Tensorflow

## Functionalities
All tasks have been done in this repo:
- Linear Regression.
- Feed Forward Neural Network.
- CNN, RNN, LSTM.
- Transfer Learning.
- Style Transfer Learning.
- Object Detection and Object Localization.


## Dependencies
* Python 3.10 is a must.
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 23.10, WSL
## Installation
First download/clone this repo to your computer
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Hung369/Image_Processing.git
```
Then create Python virtual environment in the folder that you have cloned and activate it.

In order to deploy the web app, you have to install the project with these following libraries in virtual environment (venv):

```bash
  pip3 install opencv-python
  pip3 install numpy
  pip3 install -U scikit-learn
  pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
